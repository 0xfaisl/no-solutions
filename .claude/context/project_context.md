# Zero to Full-Stack Developer Programming Course - Project Context

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Zero to Full-Stack Developer Programming Course
**Primary Goal:** Career change preparation through comprehensive programming education
**Target Audience:** Individuals seeking to transition into software development careers
**Study Commitment:** 1-2 hours daily study schedule
**Project Location:** `/Users/0xfaisl/Developer/Self-Learning Labs/React`

## Educational Philosophy
- **Build-Your-Own-X Approach:** Students create projects from scratch to understand core concepts
- **Heavy Lab Focus:** Practical, hands-on learning through extensive laboratory exercises
- **No Solutions Provided:** Students must work through challenges independently to build problem-solving skills
- **Progressive Complexity:** Each module builds upon previous knowledge systematically

## Course Structure & Curriculum Path
The course follows a carefully designed progression through modern web development technologies:

1. **Programming Fundamentals** - Core programming concepts and problem-solving
2. **JavaScript** - Modern ES6+ JavaScript development
3. **React** - Frontend development with React ecosystem
4. **TypeScript** - Type-safe development practices
5. **PostgreSQL** - Database design and management
6. **Full-Stack Integration** - Connecting all technologies into complete applications

## Current Development Status
**Active Task:** Creating Course.md with initial course structure
- **Module 0:** Course introduction and setup
- **Module 1:** Programming fundamentals
- **Module 2:** JavaScript basics
- **Initial Labs:** First 3 laboratory exercises (Lab 0, Lab 1, Lab 2)

## Development Guidelines
- Maintain consistency with Build-Your-Own-X philosophy
- Ensure each lab builds practical skills without providing direct solutions
- Structure content for 1-2 hour daily study sessions
- Focus on career-readiness and real-world application
- Progressive difficulty that prevents overwhelming students

## Key Principles for Content Creation
1. **Practical Focus:** Every concept should be immediately applicable
2. **Independent Learning:** Students must discover solutions through guided exploration
3. **Career Relevance:** All skills should directly support professional development
4. **Manageable Scope:** Content fits within daily 1-2 hour study windows
5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Full-stack competency from fundamentals to deployment

## Agent Coordination Notes
- When working on course materials, maintain the Build-Your-Own-X approach
- Avoid creating solution files or answer keys
- Focus on creating challenging but achievable laboratory exercises
- Ensure content progression supports career transition goals
- Keep daily study time constraints in mind when designing modules
