# no-solutions

**A programming curriculum where you build the solutions yourself.**

---

## What This Is

A 48-week, self-paced curriculum that takes you from zero to full-stack developer. No hand-holding. No copy-paste answers. You struggle, you learn, you build.

**Target:** Career changers with 1-2 hours daily
**Outcome:** Job-ready full-stack developer with a portfolio of deployed projects

---

## The Philosophy

### Build-Your-Own-X
You don't understand something until you've built it from scratch. In this curriculum, you'll recreate: array methods, promises, event emitters, React hooks, a query builder, an ORM, and more.

### No Solutions Provided
Labs describe the problem. You discover the answer. This mirrors real-world development where Stack Overflow won't have your exact solution.

### The Struggle IS the Learning
Every time you want to quit, you're about to level up. We don't remove the difficulty—we prepare you for it.

## What You'll Learn

| Module | Duration | Topics |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Environment & Tools | 2 weeks | Terminal, VS Code, Git |
| Programming Fundamentals | 8 weeks | Logic, functions, data structures |
| JavaScript & Web Basics | 6 weeks | ES6+, async/await, DOM, HTML/CSS |
| TypeScript | 4 weeks | Types, generics, real-world patterns |
| React | 10 weeks | Components, hooks, Server Components, testing |
| Backend & PostgreSQL | 10 weeks | Node/Express, SQL, API development, Prisma |
| Full-Stack Capstone | 8 weeks | Complete application, deployment |

---

## What You'll Build

By the end, you'll have:

- **5+ deployed projects** (not localhost screenshots—real URLs)
- **Custom implementations** of core programming concepts
- **A full-stack application** with auth, database, and production deployment
- **A GitHub profile** that tells your story through commits

### Build-Your-Own-X Projects

- CLI Calculator, Number Guessing Game, Todo List
- `myMap()`, `myFilter()`, `myReduce()`
- Promise implementation with `.then()` and `.catch()`
- Event Emitter with pub/sub pattern
- Type-safe Event Emitter (generics)
- Typed Fetch Wrapper
- Custom React Hooks (`useLocalStorage`, `useFetch`, `useDebounce`)
- Accessible Component Library
- SQL Query Builder
- Simple ORM
- Full-Stack Capstone (your choice of project)

## Who This Is For

**Yes:**
- Career changers willing to commit 1-2 hours daily for ~12 months
- People who want to actually understand code, not just copy it
- Self-motivated learners who can push through frustration

**No:**
- People looking for quick wins or shortcuts
- Those who need constant hand-holding
- Anyone who wants to "learn to code in 30 days"

## AI-Aware

This curriculum is configured for AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot). When you use AI in this repository, it automatically switches to **teaching mode**:

- Asks what you've tried before helping
- Gives hints, not answers
- Guides you to discover solutions yourself

Because a developer who can only code with AI assistance isn't really a developer.

---

## Contributing

This curriculum is opinionated by design. If you have suggestions:

1. **Found an error?** Open an issue
2. **Have a better explanation?** PRs welcome for clarity improvements
3. **Want to add solutions?** No. That's the point.

## License

MIT — Use it, fork it, teach with it. Just don't add the solutions.

## The Path

> "The master has failed more times than the beginner has tried."

Every developer you admire was once mass console.log-ing to figure out why their code didn't work. They got through it. So will you.

The path is clear. The work is yours.
