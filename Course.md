# Zero to Full-Stack Developer

A comprehensive programming course for career changers.

---

## Course Overview

**Duration:** 48 weeks (~11-12 months)
**Commitment:** 1-2 hours daily
**Target Role:** Junior Full-Stack Developer
**Philosophy:** Build-Your-Own-X, heavy labs, no solutions provided

---

## Before You Begin

**Start here.** Before writing any code, read [Module -1: Before You Begin](modules/module--1-before-you-begin.md). It covers:

- Is this course right for you?
- What to expect over the next 12 months
- The learning philosophy and why it works
- How to use this curriculum effectively
- Setting yourself up for success

Don't skip this. The 30 minutes you spend here will save you weeks of frustration later.

## Learning Philosophy

### Build-Your-Own-X
You don't truly understand something until you've built it from scratch. Throughout this course, you'll recreate fundamental tools: array methods, promises, hooks, query builders, and more. This approach builds deep understanding that tutorials cannot provide.

### No Solutions Provided
Labs describe the problem—you discover the solution. This mirrors real-world development where Stack Overflow won't have your exact answer. Struggle is part of learning; embrace it.

### Deploy Early, Deploy Often
Five deployment checkpoints ensure you're building real, working software—not just completing exercises. Employers want to see live projects.

### One Thing at a Time
Master each concept before moving on. Resist the urge to jump ahead. Foundations matter more than frameworks.

## Essential Guides

Keep these bookmarked. You'll need them.

| Guide | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| [When You're Stuck](guides/when-youre-stuck.md) | Every time you hit a wall (and you will) |
| [Troubleshooting](guides/troubleshooting.md) | When you get error messages |
| [Concept Diagrams](guides/concept-diagrams.md) | When you need to visualize how things work |
| [Using AI to Learn](guides/using-ai-to-learn.md) | Before using any AI coding assistant |

## Lab Difficulty Markers

Throughout the modules, labs are marked by priority:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🔴 **Core** | Must complete before moving on |
| 🟡 **Recommended** | Reinforces understanding, do if time permits |
| 🟢 **Stretch** | For deeper mastery, optional |

Focus on Core labs first. If you're struggling, skip Stretch labs and return later.

## Deployment Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Week | Deliverable |
|------------|------|-------------|
| GitHub Profile | 2 | Version control established, profile configured |
| Static Website | 8 | HTML/CSS/JS site on GitHub Pages or Netlify |
| React Application | 22 | Interactive React app on Vercel |
| REST API | 32 | Express API with PostgreSQL on Railway |
| Full-Stack App | 48 | Complete capstone project, production-ready |

## Weekly Study Pattern

| Day | Focus | Time |
|-----|-------|------|
| Monday | Learn new concept (docs, videos) | 45-60 min |
| Tuesday | Hands-on coding (lab work) | 60-90 min |
| Wednesday | Continue building | 60-90 min |
| Thursday | Review, refactor, debug | 45-60 min |
| Friday | Testing or mini-project | 45-60 min |
| Weekend | Catch-up or exploration | Optional |

## Core Principles

### 1. Type All Code Manually
Never copy-paste. Typing builds muscle memory and forces you to read every character.

### 2. Struggle Before Searching
When stuck, set a timer for 15-30 minutes. Try different approaches. Only then search for help. Use the [When You're Stuck](guides/when-youre-stuck.md) guide.

### 3. Build, Don't Just Learn
Every week produces working code. Reading about programming isn't programming.

### 4. Master Before Moving
Don't rush to the next module. Shaky foundations create shaky applications. Complete the Self-Assessment Checkpoint at the end of each module before moving on.

### 5. Commit Everything
Use Git from day one. Small, frequent commits. Your commit history tells your story.
